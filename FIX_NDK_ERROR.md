# 🚨 NDK ERROR FIX - IMMEDIATE SOLUTION

## Your Current Error:

```
[CXX1101] NDK at C:\Users\kumat\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\ndk\27.0.12077973 
did not have a source.properties file
```

## What This Means:

❌ Your NDK installation (version 27.0.12077973) is **corrupted** or **incomplete**  
❌ The NDK folder is missing critical files  
❌ This prevents native C++ code from building  

---

## ✅ WHAT I JUST FIXED:

### 1. Removed Deprecated Setting
**File:** `gradle.properties`
- ❌ Removed: `android.defaults.buildfeatures.buildconfig=true`
- ✅ This was causing deprecation warnings

### 2. Fixed Gradle Plugin Versions
**File:** `build.gradle`
- ❌ Was: AGP 8.13.0 (doesn't exist/unstable)
- ✅ Now: AGP 8.2.2 (stable and tested)
- ✅ Updated Kotlin to 1.9.22

### 3. Specified Valid NDK Version
**File:** `app/build.gradle`
- ✅ Added: `ndkVersion "26.1.10909125"`
- This tells Gradle to use NDK 26.x instead of broken 27.x

---

## 🔧 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NOW:

### Option 1: Let Gradle Download Correct NDK (RECOMMENDED) ⭐

#### Step 1: Sync Project
```
File → Sync Project with Gradle Files
```

Gradle will automatically:
- ✅ Detect the specified NDK version (26.1.10909125)
- ✅ Download it if not present
- ✅ Use it for your project

**Wait time:** 2-5 minutes (downloads ~500MB)

#### Step 2: After Sync Completes
```
Build → Rebuild Project
```

---

### Option 2: Install NDK Manually via SDK Manager

If automatic download fails:

#### Step 1: Open SDK Manager
```
Tools → SDK Manager
OR
Click the SDK Manager icon in toolbar
```

#### Step 2: Go to SDK Tools Tab
```
Click "SDK Tools" tab at top
```

#### Step 3: Install/Update NDK
```
☑️ Check "NDK (Side by side)"
☑️ Expand it and check version 26.1.10909125
   (or any 26.x version)
☐ Uncheck version 27.0.12077973 (if shown)

Click "Apply"
Wait for installation
```

#### Step 4: Sync and Rebuild
```
File → Sync Project with Gradle Files
Build → Rebuild Project
```

---

### Option 3: Delete Corrupted NDK Folder

If nothing works:

#### Step 1: Close Android Studio

#### Step 2: Delete Corrupted NDK
```
Navigate to: C:\Users\kumat\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\ndk\
Delete folder: 27.0.12077973
```

#### Step 3: Reopen Android Studio
```
Open your project
Let it download NDK 26.x automatically
```

## 📊 What Should Happen:

### During Sync:
```
⏳ Downloading NDK 26.1.10909125...
⏳ Extracting...
✅ NDK installed successfully
✅ Sync completed
```

### During Build:
```
✅ Configuring project :app
✅ Using NDK 26.1.10909125
✅ CMake configuration successful
✅ Building native libraries
✅ BUILD SUCCESSFUL
```

## ⚠️ Common Issues:

### Issue 1: "NDK download failed"
**Cause:** Network/firewall issue  
**Solution:**
```
1. Check internet connection
2. Disable VPN/proxy temporarily
3. Try SDK Manager manual install (Option 2)
```

### Issue 2: "NDK version not available"
**Solution:**
```
In app/build.gradle, change:
ndkVersion "26.1.10909125"

To any available 25.x or 26.x version:
ndkVersion "25.2.9519653"
OR
ndkVersion "26.0.10792818"
```

### Issue 3: Still getting version 27.x error
**Solution:**
```
1. Delete C:\Users\kumat\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\ndk\27.0.12077973
2. File → Invalidate Caches / Restart
3. File → Sync Project with Gradle Files
```

## 🎯 Expected Final Result:

After all fixes:
```
✅ No NDK errors
✅ No deprecation warnings
✅ BUILD SUCCESSFUL
✅ Native libraries compiled
✅ APK ready to install
```

## 💡 Why NDK 27.x is Broken:

- NDK 27.x is a **preview/beta** version
- Not stable for production use
- Missing critical configuration files
- Not compatible with most AGP versions
- **Solution:** Use stable NDK 26.x or 25.x

---

## ✨ After This Fix:

Your project will use:
- ✅ NDK 26.1.10909125 (stable)
- ✅ AGP 8.2.2 (stable)
- ✅ Kotlin 1.9.22 (latest stable)
- ✅ No deprecated settings
- ✅ All compatible versions
