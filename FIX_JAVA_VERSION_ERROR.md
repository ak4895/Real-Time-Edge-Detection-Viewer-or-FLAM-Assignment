# IMMEDIATE FIX FOR "Unsupported class file major version 65"

## What This Error Means

You're using **Java 21**, but Gradle 8.0 doesn't support it. You need either:
- Gradle 8.5+ for Java 21 support, OR
- Downgrade to Java 17

## FASTEST FIX (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Clear Gradle Cache
1. Close Android Studio completely
2. Open File Explorer
3. Navigate to: `C:\Users\kumat\.gradle\caches`
4. Delete the entire `caches` folder
5. Also delete: `C:\Users\kumat\.gradle\daemon`

### Step 2: Update Gradle Wrapper
Already done! Your project uses Gradle 9.0 which supports Java 21.

### Step 3: Restart Android Studio
1. Open Android Studio
2. Open your project
3. Wait for Gradle sync to complete
4. If it asks to update anything, click "Update"

### Step 4: Sync Project
1. Click **File → Sync Project with Gradle Files**
2. Wait for completion

## If Still Fails - Use Java 17 Instead

### Check Current Java Version in Android Studio
1. **File → Settings**
2. **Build, Execution, Deployment → Build Tools → Gradle**
3. Look at **Gradle JDK** setting

### Change to Java 17
1. In same settings window
2. Click dropdown next to **Gradle JDK**
3. Select **Download JDK**
4. Choose:
   - Vendor: **Eclipse Temurin**
   - Version: **17**
5. Click **Download**
6. Wait for download to complete
7. Click **OK**
8. Sync project again

## Verify Fix

After syncing, you should see:
```
✅ BUILD SUCCESSFUL
✅ No "Unsupported class file" errors
```

## Alternative: Command Line Fix

Open PowerShell in your project directory:

```powershell
# Stop all Gradle daemons
.\gradlew --stop

# Clean the project
.\gradlew clean

# Sync and build
.\gradlew build
```

## Why This Happened

| Java Version | Class File Version | Compatible Gradle |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Java 17 | 61 | Gradle 7.3+ |
| Java 19 | 63 | Gradle 7.6+ |
| Java 21 | 65 | Gradle 8.5+ |

You have Java 21 (version 65), which requires Gradle 8.5 or newer.

## What Was Updated

✅ `build.gradle` - Updated to AGP 8.2.0 and Kotlin 1.9.20  
✅ `app/build.gradle` - Updated dependencies to latest stable  
✅ Compatible with both Java 17 and Java 21  

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Clear Gradle cache (instructions above)
2. ✅ Restart Android Studio
3. ✅ Sync project
4. ✅ Build should now succeed

## Still Having Issues?

Try this nuclear option:
1. Close Android Studio
2. Delete these folders:
   - `.gradle` (in project root)
   - `.idea` (in project root)
   - `C:\Users\kumat\.gradle\caches`
   - `C:\Users\kumat\.gradle\daemon`
3. Reopen Android Studio
4. Let it reimport the project
5. Sync and build

**This should fix your error! The project files have been updated to support Java 21 with Gradle 9.0.**
