## üîß Build Process Checklist

### Initial Build Steps
1. [ ] Open project in Android Studio
2. [ ] Wait for Gradle sync to complete
3. [ ] Check "Build" tab for any errors
4. [ ] If errors, consult ERROR_FIXES.md

### Clean Build
1. [ ] Build ‚Üí Clean Project
2. [ ] Wait for clean to complete
3. [ ] Build ‚Üí Rebuild Project
4. [ ] Check for successful build message

### Verify Native Build
1. [ ] Check Build Output for CMake messages
2. [ ] Verify "Build edge_detection" appears
3. [ ] Check for "OpenCV version: X.X.X" message
4. [ ] No errors in CMake configuration

### APK Generation
1. [ ] APK file created in `app/build/outputs/apk/debug/`
2. [ ] APK size is reasonable (10-50 MB depending on OpenCV)
3. [ ] .so libraries included in APK

## üì± Device Setup Checklist

### Device Preparation
- [ ] Developer options enabled
- [ ] USB debugging enabled
- [ ] Device connected via USB
- [ ] Device recognized in Android Studio (appears in device dropdown)
- [ ] Device running Android 5.0 (API 21) or higher

### Installation
1. [ ] Click Run button (green triangle)
2. [ ] Select target device
3. [ ] Wait for installation
4. [ ] App launches automatically

### Permissions
- [ ] Camera permission prompt appears
- [ ] Camera permission granted
- [ ] App shows camera feed

## ‚úîÔ∏è Functionality Verification

### App Launch
- [ ] App launches without crashing
- [ ] No black screen
- [ ] GLSurfaceView is visible

### Camera Feed
- [ ] Camera preview appears
- [ ] Preview is not blank
- [ ] Preview is not frozen

### Edge Detection
- [ ] Edges are visible in the camera feed
- [ ] Edge detection updates in real-time
- [ ] Processing is smooth

### Performance
- [ ] FPS counter is visible
- [ ] FPS is 10 or higher
- [ ] Resolution is displayed correctly
- [ ] No significant lag

### No Crashes
- [ ] App doesn't crash on startup
- [ ] App doesn't crash during use
- [ ] App doesn't crash on rotation (if supported)
- [ ] App doesn't crash when paused/resumed

## üêõ Common Issues Quick Check

If build fails, check:
- [ ] OpenCV path in CMakeLists.txt
- [ ] NDK is installed
- [ ] CMake is installed
- [ ] Internet connection for Gradle dependencies
- [ ] No spaces in project path
- [ ] JDK 17 is being used

If app crashes, check:
- [ ] Camera permission granted
- [ ] Native libraries built successfully
- [ ] Logcat for error messages
- [ ] Device supports OpenGL ES 2.0+

If performance is poor:
- [ ] Testing on physical device (not emulator)
- [ ] Build type is Debug (Release is faster)
- [ ] Edge detection parameters are reasonable

## üìã Final Verification

Before considering the project complete:
- [ ] Project builds without errors
- [ ] Project builds without warnings (or only expected warnings)
- [ ] App installs on device
- [ ] App runs smoothly
- [ ] All features work as expected
- [ ] FPS is acceptable (10-15+)
- [ ] No crashes during normal use
- [ ] Code is clean and well-commented

## üéØ Success Criteria

Your project is ready when:
‚úÖ Clean build completes successfully  
‚úÖ App installs without errors  
‚úÖ Camera feed shows edge detection in real-time  
‚úÖ FPS counter shows 10+ FPS  
‚úÖ No crashes during 5 minutes of use  
‚úÖ App responds to pause/resume correctly  

## Next Steps

Once all checks pass:
1. Test on multiple devices
2. Test different lighting conditions
3. Test edge detection on various objects
4. Optimize performance if needed
5. Build release APK for distribution

## Need Help?

If any checklist item fails:
1. See ERROR_FIXES.md for specific solutions
2. See INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md for setup details
3. Check Logcat for detailed error messages
4. Verify all paths and configurations
