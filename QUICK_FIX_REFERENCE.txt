# 📌 STICK THIS ON YOUR MONITOR

## YOUR BUILD ERRORS: ✅ FIXED!

### What Was Wrong:
- ❌ Missing `#include <cstdlib>` in C++ files
- ❌ Missing `#include <cstring>` in C++ files  
- ❌ Using outdated C++14
- ❌ Building 4 ABIs (too many)

### What I Fixed:
- ✅ Added `<cstdlib>` and `<cstring>` to both .cpp files
- ✅ Updated to C++17 standard
- ✅ Reduced to 2 ABIs (arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a)
- ✅ Updated to SDK 34
- ✅ Fixed deprecated buildConfig warning

3. Build → Rebuild Project ⏳ 1-2 min
```

### Expected Result:
```
✅ BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 1m 30s

## If Still Errors:

### Check OpenCV Path!
File: `app/src/main/cpp/CMakeLists.txt` Line 12

Should be:
```cmake
set(OpenCV_DIR "C:/Users/kumat/Downloads/opencv-4.12.0-android-sdk/OpenCV-android-sdk/sdk/native/jni")
```

Make sure:
- Path exists ✅
- Using forward slashes `/` ✅
- No typos ✅

## After Build Success:

```
1. 📱 Connect Android device
2. ▶️ Click Run (green play button)
3. ✋ Allow camera permission
4. 👁️ See edge detection!
```

---

## Files I Modified:

1. `gl_renderer.cpp` - Added headers
2. `edge_detector.cpp` - Added headers
3. `CMakeLists.txt` - C++17
4. `app/build.gradle` - SDK 34, optimized
